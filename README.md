## üß™ Labs Overview

- **Lab 01 ‚Äì Search Algorithms**  
  Implementation of uninformed and informed search strategies (DFS, BFS, A*, etc.) applied to problem-solving tasks:
  - Lab 1: Maze Solving with NetworkX
  - Lab 2: Solving the 9-Puzzle Game (Taquin) with NetworkX  

- **Lab 02 ‚Äì Adversial Game**  
  Exploring strategic decision-making and game-playing algorithms in AI, including adversarial search, minimax, and alpha-beta pruning. 

- **Lab 03 ‚Äì Machine Learning**  
  Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict Titanic passenger survival using features like age, sex, and ticket class. The lab includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and explanation of model predictions using XAI techniques.
